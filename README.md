# Terry Traffic Stop Arrest Analysis

## Objective
Using a dataset of 45,376 police reported stops under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. a(1968), the objective is to find the demographic variables that most influence arresting a subject. I will then use this information to attempt to predict future arrests based on certain demographics.

## First things First
The first step in analyzing this large data set is to clean and organize the data.  Processes included removing extra spaces, removing data that would not be used, replacing dashes with "unknown", combining duplicate columns and creating dummies for all relevant variables.  In total, the revised dataset contained 41 demographic related columns.
